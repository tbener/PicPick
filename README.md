## Description
You can determine the structure of the destination folders by using the standard windows notations:<br>
d, dd = day, <br>
ddd, dddd = day of the week<br>
M = month<br>
y, yyy = year<br>
m = minute<br>
H = 24-hour clock<br>
h = 12-hour clock<br>
s = second<br>
t = AM/PM<br>
The date \ time of a file will be taken from the “date taken” property of the photo or video, if it exists. If not, the file creation date will be used.<br>
